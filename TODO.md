TO DO
=====

* fix background rendering for when camera is near edge and world size is big
* implement Thing-Block collisions
* when non-static Thing collides with a static Thing, speed should be set to 0 in the correct axis and non-static Thing should be moved to edge of static Thing
* add variable animation speed
* add Texture rotation (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8639567/java-rotating-images)
